83 The code outputs is both clear and concise with the percentage of the global population represented. It is accurate and easy to understand.
qt The program gives a straightforward answer, but the phrasing of the output could be more polished. Still, it accurately reports the percentage.
4d It provides both the percentage and the actual number of people represented, which adds value. but, the phrasing is less smooth compared to others as well.
fi The code gives the correct percentage, but the output is too brief and lacks the clarity of a full sentence. Thereâ€™s no context
qy The output includes a percentage, but the phrasing feels awkward and less professional than others.
zp The code encounters an error, so it fails to provide any meaningful output because they put commas and python does not validate them. The issue stems from trying to perform a division on a tuple instead of numeric values. Also there are no sources.
