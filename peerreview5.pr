The results are: Die 1 =  5 and Die 2 =  8609
The sum of the results is  8614  and is NOT a multiple of 3...try again!

You got a 9 and 2442
The sum is 2451 and it is multiple of 3

A 9-sided die casted:  6
A 9000-sided die casted:  3916
The sum of the results is NOT a multiple of three

5t.py
Your nine-sided dice roll was a 5
Your 9000 sided dice roll was a 7817
The sum of your dice roll is 7822 which is not evenly divisible by 3

The sum of 8 and 3494 is 3502.
The sum is not a multiple of 3.

mx.py
You roll 9 on the 9-sided die & 8996 on the 9000-sided die.
The sum of these rolls is NOT a multiple of three.

7c 9 dice rolled  2  and the 9000 dice rolled  6514  which both summed up to be  6516 .



7c This one nails it! The die rolls are clearly stated, followed by the sum, and it directly confirms that the sum is a multiple of three. The wording is concise and clear, giving exactly what’s needed.

65 This output gets straight to the point. It shows both die rolls, calculates the sum, and confirms it’s a multiple of three. The direct phrasing makes it easy to follow and understand.

4x The results are clearly laid out, with both die rolls, the sum, and whether it’s a multiple of three. It’s a bit more wordy with the "try again" phrase, but it adds a bit of personality without losing clarity.

z7 You get the die results, the sum, and a direct statement about whether the sum is a multiple of three. The format works, but it’s very brief and could use a bit more structure for smoother reading.

mx The die rolls and sum are clearly presented, with a direct statement about whether the sum is a multiple of three. The phrasing works but could be a little sharper for a more polished feel.

5t While the output provides everything needed, the phrasing feels clunky ("...which is not evenly divisible by 3"). A more straightforward approach would make this clearer and quicker to process.

yv This one falls short by not showing the sum, which is key to verifying whether the result is a multiple of three. It’s concise but misses out on essential details, making it the least effective.
