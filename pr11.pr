m8 This program uses regex effectively and is modular, but it could benefit from stricter error handling. Its clear structure makes it easy to maintain and extend.
3u It filters words well using sets, but comments and handling for edge cases need improvement. Adding more robust error handling would make it more user-friendly.
fa Great validation for input files, but it lacks logic for insufficient qualifying words. Improving output clarity and reusability would enhance its usefulness.
iv The while loop ensures 10 random words, but it needs optimization and better input checks. Refactoring to avoid redundant operations would increase efficiency.
3c The functions are well-structured. The function open_and_read_file is called correctly (the self parameter is unnecessary) and fix error handling for edge cases. Fixing these issues would unlock its potential.
ks t is concise with collections.Counter, but it not the best at handling smaller "datasets". A more dynamic approach to word length filtering would make it versatile.
ac The implementation is simple but hardcoded paths and poor error handling make it less practical. Adding flexibility and basic validation would make it significantly more effective.
