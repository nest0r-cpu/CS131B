ty The program is clean, concise, and well-organized; it ran smoothly, and overall the best output information was given. One improvement would be to avoid repeating variables, and the variable naming could be cleaner.
fc The program runs effectively and calculates percentages very well. One improvement would be to add error handling and simplify the loop structure to reduce clutter, but overall, a great program that follows all the rules.
iv The program runs smoothly but is overly complex for the task. To improve it, I would simplify list operations and reduce unnecessary variable assignments to enhance readability.
2e Effective use of list comprehension but slightly overcomplicated with splits. I would use a direct list rather than string joining/splitting for simpler handling of sums.
9e The program accomplishes the task but has extra steps that can be optimized and lacks efficient list handling. I would simplify the loop structure and avoid excessive print statements for clearer code and readability.
d9 Functional program but has unnecessary use of list comprehension for dictionary operations. Instead, use a loop to simplify element counting and focus directly on dictionary use for a more optimized program.
v4 The program contains logic errors, and some variable names are confusing. I would correct dictionary usage, remove unused variables, and refactor for readability so that other programmers can better understand the program.
