fq The program is both clean and efficient, because of the use of list comprehensions  to filter and sum integers, demonstrating excellent use of exception handling. The output is user-friendly and clearly displays the valid integers and their sum. It could be improved by adding a message when no valid integers are passed to inform the user appropriately.
nw The program correctly uses try-except to filter out non-integer values and raises a TypeError if no integers are found. It effectively prints both the list of integers and their sum, making the output clear. I did see that the code, contains several typos ("interger," "cammand") that should be fixed, and variable naming could be more descriptive, to help with readability.
kg This code filters integers while providing error messages for non-integer inputs, giving users a clear feedback about invalid inputs. The use of a list to store valid integers ensures all results are processed properly. However, the logic for detecting commas might be unnecessary and could be removed to simplify the code, but thats something that is an option.
64 The program efficiently uses map and filter to process and sum integers, it's a compact approach. It also handles exceptions for invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth process. I would add a function to give feedback about which integers were processed, and the error message for no inputs could be more descriptive.
te This program provides a straightforward and functional pieces for summing integers, with a simple try-except loop to handle non-integer values. It produces clean output. Something I would look over agin is, the program could benefit in including feedback on invalid inputs and formatting the output a little more descriptively.
hu The program effectively handles scenarios with no input or only invalid inputs, making it clear and concise for the user.It uses try-except appropriately to filter integers, and storing valid ones in a list. However, the final output could include the integers being summed for more transparency and user engagement.
dj The code is simple and effectively calculates the sum of integers passed via command-line arguments. It uses a try-except block for error handling but does not specify the exception type. This could mask other errors. Additionally, the output formatting could be improved to include details about valid and invalid inputs for better user experience.
